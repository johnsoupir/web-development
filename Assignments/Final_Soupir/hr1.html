	      <h2 class="subSectionTitle">About</h2>
	      <h2 class="subSubSectionTitle">I built HR-1 in 2016 as my first adventure into Arduino and robotics. He was built to look as much like a typical humanoid robot as possible. Control is via a Bluetooth to UART module, and a live video feed is served over the network from an Android phone inside the head. All the joints are moved by hobby servos, and the entire frame is build from aluminum stock and wood from Menards. The servos are powered from a 6V lead acid battery, and the wheels are powerd from a seperate 12v lead acid battery. </h2>
	      <h2 class="subSubSectionTitle">All the code was written in the Arduino IDE and was heavily inspired by the Kewlsoft LED example. A letter is sent followed by a integer value. The letter is used to determine which servo should respond, and the intger value is the angle to move to (from 0 to 180 degrees).</h2>
